                'This dataset is used for the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) II Competition (Dataset IV), provided by Fraunhofer-FIRST, Intelligent Data Analysis Group (Klaus-Robert Muller), and the Neurophysics Group, Department of Neurology, Free University of Berlin (Gabriel Curio). '
                'The dataset includes EEG data recorded from normal subjects during a no-feedback session, with the goal of predicting the subject upcoming left or right-hand movement. The experimental conditions are as follows:'
                '- **Subject Condition:** The subjects sat on a regular chair with their arms relaxed on a table, with their fingers positioned on a computer keyboard in a standard typing posture.'
                '- **Task Description:** The subjects were required to press the corresponding keys with their index and pinky fingers, following a self-paced typing task.'
                '- **Class Definition:** There are two classes: `0` indicates an upcoming left-hand movement, and `1` indicates an upcoming right-hand movement.'
                '- **Data Acquisition:** The experiment consists of three sessions, each lasting 6 minutes. All sessions were conducted on the same day with a few minutes of rest in between. The average typing speed was one key per second. The EEG signals were recorded using NeuroScan amplifiers and ECIs Ag/AgCl electrode cap.'
                '- **Data Sampling and Preprocessing:** The signals were recorded using a band-pass filter between 0.05 and 200 Hz at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz, then downsampled to 100 Hz. Each channel contains 50 observations. Each sample ends 130 ms before the keypress, making the length of each sample 500 ms.'

                '1. **Frontal Area (F region)**'
                '   - **F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4**: Located in the frontal lobe, involved in decision-making, motor preparation, working memory, and attention. The Fz channel is particularly associated with motor control and the planning phase of task execution.'
                '2. **Frontal-Central Area (FC region)**'
                '   - **FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6**: These are transition regions between the frontal lobe and motor areas. The FCz channel is often related to the premotor cortex and supplementary motor area activities, especially in motor preparation and planning.'
                '3. **Central Area (C region)**'
                '   - **C5, C3, C1, Cz, C2, C4, C6**: These channels are closely related to the motor cortex. **C3** (left hemisphere) is associated with right-hand movements, while **C4** (right hemisphere) is associated with left-hand movements. **Cz** is located at the midline, involved in bilateral motor control.'
                '4. **Central-Parietal Area (CP region)**'
                '   - **CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6**: Located at the posterior part of the head, these primarily reflect somatosensory cortex and sensory integration area activities. These regions play a role in motor imagery and motor-sensory feedback.'
                '5. **Occipital Area (O region)**'
                '   - **O1, O2**: These channels are located in the occipital lobe, primarily reflecting the activities of the visual processing regions. Although these regions have less direct relevance to motor tasks, they may provide auxiliary information in visually guided motor tasks.'
                '**Biological Significance of Frequency Analysis:**'

                '- **Beta waves (13-30 Hz):** Related to motor preparation and execution, and focused attention. During motor preparation, particularly on C3 and C4 channels, beta activity often decreases (Event-Related Desynchronization, ERD).'
                '- **Theta waves (4-7 Hz):** Associated with memory and attentional processes, often observed in the frontal region (Fz).'
                '- **Delta waves (0.5-4 Hz):** Usually related to deep sleep or pathological states.'
                '- **Gamma waves (30-50 Hz):** Linked to high-level cognitive functions and consciousness; may be associated with local synchronization in motor-related activities.'

This similarity measure helps us identify samples with similar electrophysiological activity patterns in both time and space.
